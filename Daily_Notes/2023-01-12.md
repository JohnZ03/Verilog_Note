The HDL host interface is a slave interface from the host.Â  It runs at a fixed clock rate that is dependent upon the interface type for the device.

-   USB 2.0 interfaces run at 48 MHz (20.83 ns clock period)
-   USB 3.0 interfaces run at 100.8 MHz (9.92 ns clock period)
-   PCI Express (x1) interfaces run at 50 MHz (20 ns clock period)
