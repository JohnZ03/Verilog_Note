# Python code:
What to look at:
1. `def param_set` in `t6.py`
2. `MASTER_MODE` in `src\python\runT7_simpleExample_1.py` 
3. See if we can make a small sacle design for everyone to try

# XEM:
1. _DDR3 interface (might need)_ NOT REALLY IMPORTANT HERE
2. Opal Kelly interface from 


# FIFOs:
fifo_w256_128_r256_128_standard pipeIn_img_inst


How to see the critical path in Vivado? Once the implementation is completed, **click "Reports" at the bottom of Vivado GUI.** **Then click "Timing Summary Report" under "Route Design"**. As an alternative, you may also search blabla_timing_summary_routed.



1. Try out on the testbench
2. send note repo
3. send sample designs
4. go with your own pace
