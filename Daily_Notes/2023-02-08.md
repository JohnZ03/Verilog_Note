## Plans for the FIFO
w230_r160, which is 160=32\*5
We can have a module that handles these five packets
OR
We can have 2 more sub-fifos, w128_r32 and w32_r32. Read from those two.
OR
Have one more sub-fifo, w128_r32 and have a module to convert 160 into 128 with each reads.

Instead:
__w256_r32 and w64_r32
8 cycles and 2 cycles__

Need first word fall through, regular fifo has 7 cycles of delay.
